# neutrino_damping
This is the code associated with my summer project with Prof. Tina Kahniashvili in 2023. It has all my work with the paper "Damping of Tensor Modes in Cosmology" https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0306304.pdf by Steven Weinberg.

All of the files have a folder with the attachment "_figs" at the end of the name of the python file associated with them. These are the folders that contain the figures generated from the associated python file. 

# Files and what they do
- analytical.py has my code that looks at the analytical solution (by this, I mean using a scipy function to generate the values of the solution) of Eq. 21 from the paper. 
- general_wavelength.py looks at my numerical solutions to equation (32) from the paper which is the equation with a substitutions for the general wavelengths
- short_wavelength.py looks at my numerical solutions to equation (23) from the paper
